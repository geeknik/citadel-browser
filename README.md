## 𝗢𝘂𝗿 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻

Citadel isn't just a browser engine—it's a declaration of digital human rights. We're built for those who understand that privacy is not a luxury—it's a fundamental necessity.

In an era where users are treated as products and their data harvested without consent, we're taking a scorched-earth approach to browser privacy that makes surveillance capitalism weep.

Open-source. Uncompromising. Zero-tracking. Future-proof.

### 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲
Privacy isn't just a feature. It's the entire point of our existence.

### 𝗩𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆
Zero compromise on user control over their digital experience.

### 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘁𝘆
Users control their data with no forced third-party dependencies.

## 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴

### 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗡𝗲𝘂𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
Dynamic blocklists + machine learning detection that annihilates even the most persistent tracking attempts.

### 𝗔𝗻𝘁𝗶-𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴
Canvas fingerprinting prevention, hardware API restriction, and tactical noise injection to mask your digital identity.

### 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅𝗶𝗻𝗴
Per-site process isolation with strict content security policies and cross-site data access prevention.

### 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗰𝘆
User-controlled DNS resolution, minimal HTTP headers, and connection fingerprint randomization.

### 𝗖𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗶𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹
First-party isolation, automatic expiration, and granular user-controlled storage permissions.

### 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘁𝘆
Granular privacy controls, transparent data logs, and one-click protection escalation.

## 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀

Citadel is built with these core components, all implemented with Rust's strong encapsulation features:

### 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿
- Weaponized HTML/CSS/JS parsing with injection-proof design and malformed input termination protocols
- Attack surface minimization through careful API implementation and selective standard support
- Security-first input handling designed to fail closed rather than open when encountering edge cases

### 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲 ✅
- **Integrated rquickjs engine** with hardcore sandbox environment and surgically removed tracking APIs
- **DOM bindings implemented** with security policies and CSP compliance enforcement
- **Privacy-preserving execution** with zero external data transmission capabilities for scripts
- **Comprehensive test suite** with DOM integration and security validation (all tests passing)
- Performance-optimized execution that doesn't sacrifice security for convenience

### 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿
- User-controlled DNS resolution with local cache by default and no reliance on third-party DNS services
- HTTPS-or-die approach that defaults to secure connections and hardens TLS implementation
- Connection fingerprint randomization to prevent server-side tracking and correlation

### 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲
- Granular privacy controls that give users complete visibility and authority over their data
- Transparent data transmission logs showing exactly what information websites are attempting to access
- Vertical tabs by default for improved usability and efficient screen space utilization

## Networking Features

The networking layer is the foundation of Citadel's privacy-preserving architecture:

### Privacy-First DNS

- **Local Cache by Default**: Minimize network requests that could be tracked
- **No Third-Party DNS Services**: We never use external DNS services without your explicit consent
- **Optional Secure DNS**: Support for DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) as user options
- **Normalized TTLs**: Prevent timing-based tracking through DNS

### Secure Connections

- **HTTPS Only**: All connections must use HTTPS for privacy and security
- **Strict TLS**: Modern, secure TLS configurations
- **Certificate Validation**: Thorough certificate checking
- **Connection Security Levels**: Configure security vs. compatibility

### Privacy-Enhanced Requests

- **Header Management**: Remove or normalize headers that could be used for tracking
- **Fingerprint Randomization**: Prevent browser fingerprinting through request headers
- **User-Agent Control**: Randomize or normalize your User-Agent
- **URL Cleaning**: Automatically strip tracking parameters from URLs
- **Privacy Levels**: Configure maximum, high, or balanced privacy settings

### UI Features

- **Tab Management**
  - **Vertical Tabs**: Enabled by default for better screen utilization and improved tab visibility
  - **Tab Bar Visibility**: Toggle tab bar on/off with Ctrl+H
  - **Tab Layout**: Switch between vertical and horizontal tabs with Ctrl+Shift+V
  - **Theme Support**: Choose between light, dark, or system theme

## Privacy & Security Features

### Key Privacy Principles

- **User Sovereignty**: All privacy decisions are in your hands
- **No Third-Party Dependencies**: Local cache for DNS by default - no data sent to third-party DNS providers
- **Zero Tracking**: No fingerprinting, no tracking, no exceptions

## Design Patterns

### Rust Module Architecture

All major components in Citadel use Rust's powerful module system, which provides:

- **Improved Encapsulation**: Implementation details are hidden from the public interface
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system eliminates entire classes of bugs
- **Fearless Concurrency**: Safe concurrent code without data races
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level concepts without runtime overhead
- **Cleaner Code Organization**: Clear separation between interface and implementation

## Getting Started

### Platform Support

Citadel Browser is primarily designed for **macOS**, with limited Linux support for unit testing and development purposes.

- **macOS**: Primary platform with full feature support
- **Linux**: Limited support for development and testing only

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable)
- macOS 11.0+ (Big Sur or newer)
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- For Linux development/testing only:
  - pkg-config
  - OpenSSL dev packages
  - Fontconfig dev packages

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/citadel-browser-rust.git
cd citadel-browser-rust
cargo build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Running Examples

```bash

## Testing & Security

### Security-First Development

Citadel is built with a security-first mindset. We use several approaches to ensure our code is robust:

#### Comprehensive Testing

```bash
# Run the standard test suite
cargo test

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test '*'
```

#### Continuous Fuzzing

We employ aggressive fuzzing to discover and fix security issues before they reach production:

```bash
# Switch to nightly Rust (required for fuzzing)
rustup default nightly

# Install LLVM tools component
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview

# Install cargo-fuzz (required for fuzzing)
cargo install cargo-fuzz

# Generate corpus for more effective fuzzing
./fuzz/scripts/generate_corpus.sh

# Run all fuzzers with enhanced memory checking
./fuzz/scripts/run_all_fuzzers.sh

# Or run individual fuzzers with dictionaries
cd fuzz && cargo fuzz run dns_resolver corpus/dns_resolver -dict=dictionaries/dns.dict
```

Each fuzzer uses dictionaries and corpus files specifically designed to test edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities. Our CI automatically runs these fuzzers on every commit to ensure continuous security testing.

See [FUZZING.md](FUZZING.md) for our complete fuzzing strategy and details on how to contribute to our security efforts.

Any fuzzing failures are considered critical build failures and must be addressed immediately to maintain our security standards.
