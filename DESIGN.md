# DESIGN.md for Citadel Engine

## Overview

𝗧𝗟;𝗗𝗥: Citadel is a from-scratch browser engine engineered to demolish tracking, neutralize fingerprinting, and restore user privacy with extreme technical precision.

## Principles and Goals

Core Directives:

- 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲: Privacy isn't a feature. It's the entire fucking point.
- 𝗩𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆: Zero compromise on user control.
- 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘁𝘆: Users control their data and connections, with no forced third-party service dependencies.

Threat Landscape Neutralization:

- Crush tracking mechanisms
- Eliminate data collection vectors
- Prevent metadata leakage
- Mandate user sovereignty

## Architectural Components

### 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗲𝗿

- Weaponized HTML/CSS/JS parsing
- Injection-proof design
- Malformed input termination protocols
- Minimal attack surface

### 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲

- Hardcore sandbox environment
- Surgically removed tracking APIs
- Performance-optimized execution
- Zero external data transmission

### 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿

- User-controlled DNS resolution with local cache by default
- NO third-party DNS services used by default - respecting user sovereignty
- Optional secure DNS modes (DOH/DOT) - user choice, not forced
- HTTPS or die
- Minimal HTTP headers
- Connection fingerprint randomization

## Privacy-Enhancement Arsenal

### 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴

- Dynamic, frequently updated blocklists
- Machine learning tracker detection
- Zero-tolerance blocking mechanism

### 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

- Canvas/WebGL noise injection
- Hardware API access restriction
- Standardized output generation

### 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴

- No local data storage
- Ephemeral session management
- Automatic data scorching

## Security Mechanisms

### 𝗜𝘀𝗼𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀

- Per-site process containment
- Strict Content Security Policy
- Cross-site data access prevention

### 𝗖𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗶𝗲 & 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

- First-party isolation
- Automatic expiration
- User-controlled storage

## Threat Model

Neutralization Targets:

- Malicious websites
- Corporate tracking
- Network-level surveillance
- Fingerprinting attempts
- Metadata exploitation

## User Empowerment

### 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲

- Granular privacy settings
- Transparent data transmission logs
- One-click protection escalation
- Vertical tabs by default for improved usability
- User-controlled tab and window layout

## Implementation Challenges

Potential Friction Points:

- Website compatibility
- Performance optimization
