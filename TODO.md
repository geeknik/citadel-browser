## 📝 Notes

### Dependencies to Monitor
- `rquickjs`: JavaScript engine - monitor for updates and security patches
- `iced`: UI framework - track performance improvements
- `tokio`: Async runtime - stay current with latest stable
- `rustls`: TLS implementation - critical for security

### Technical Debt
- Code organization could be improved in some modules
- Some components have tight coupling that should be loosened
- Error handling could be more consistent across modules
