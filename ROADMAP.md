# Citadel Browser Engine: Rust Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step approach for implementing the Citadel Browser Engine in Rust. The plan focuses on building components independently before integration, ensuring each piece is solid, well-tested, and aligned with our privacy-first principles.

## Core Principles Throughout Development

- **Privacy First**: Every component design decision starts with privacy considerations
- **Zero Tracking**: No fingerprinting, no tracking, no exceptions
- **User Sovereignty**: All privacy decisions remain in the user's hands
- **No Third-Party Dependencies**: Self-reliance over external services
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive tests for all components

## Phase 1: Foundations

- User event handling
- Theme management

## Phase 5: Integration and Refinement

### 9. Component Integration

Connect all systems into a cohesive browser engine.

#### Tasks

- Create clean interfaces between components
- Develop communication patterns
- Optimize cross-component performance
- Implement global event system

### 10. Performance Optimization

Focus on making the engine both private and performant.

#### Tasks

- Identify bottlenecks
- Implement parallel processing where appropriate
- Optimize memory usage
- Reduce startup time

### 11. Security Audit

Comprehensive review of the entire codebase for security issues.

#### Tasks

- Code review for security issues
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability assessment
- Fix security issues

## Phase 6: Expanding Capabilities

### 12. Extension API

Create a privacy-respecting extension system.

#### Components

- **API Surface**:
  - Limited, privacy-respecting capabilities
  - Strict permission model
  - Sandboxed execution

- **Management**:

#### Components

- **Inspector**:
  - DOM exploration
  - Style inspection
  - Layout visualization

- **Debugging Tools**:
  - JavaScript debugger
  - Network monitor
  - Performance analysis

## Testing Strategy

Each component should include:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between closely related components
3. **System Tests**: Test complete workflows across components
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure components meet performance targets
5. **Security Tests**: Verify security properties of each component

## Development Approach

1. **Start Small**: Begin with minimal viable implementations
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Short cycles with frequent testing
3. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on every commit
4. **Documentation First**: Document interfaces before implementation
5. **Security Reviews**: Regular security-focused code reviews

## Recommended Rust Libraries

While maintaining our independence, these well-vetted libraries could accelerate development:

- **Networking**: `tokio`, `hyper`, `rustls`
- **HTML Parsing**: Consider `html5ever` or a custom parser based on its approach
- **CSS Parsing**: Consider `cssparser` or custom implementation
- **UI**: `druid`, `iced`, or `egui` for native UI components
- **Testing**: `proptest` for property-based testing, `criterion` for benchmarking

## Next Steps

1. Initialize project repository with Cargo workspace
2. Implement the networking layer foundations
3. Create detailed specifications for each component
4. Establish testing framework and CI pipeline
5. Begin implementation following this roadmap

Remember: Privacy is not a feature—it's the entire point of Citadel.
